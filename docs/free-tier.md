title: Free tier
---

New users can add two (2) devices for free to test out Mudmap. No credit 
cards or time limits.

## How does it work?

Simply sign up and get started today. The two device limit lets you test 
out Mudmap and get a feel for it. No credit card required until you 
cross the threshold - you're third device.

### What happens when I add my third device?

Adding a third device *will* trigger a payment screen where you'll have to 
provide a credit card. 

No matter how long you've been a user of Mudmap, you're first payment will 
be one (1) month after you've connected the third device and added the 
payment information.

Simply put, test out Mudmap with two devices. Add a third and you'll be 
paying for each device thereafter on a monthly subscription.

### Does this last forever?

Nothing lasts forever, but it's not going anywhere for a while. Any changes 
to the free tier will be well publicised and fair notice will be issued.
