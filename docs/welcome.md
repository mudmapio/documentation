[Mudmap] is a simple and easy to use management platform for *pfSense*Â®
firewalls. It has been built to save you time and make management of your
devices easier. 

This is the documentation for [Mudmap]. It is a great place to start and read
up on how to best integrate your devices into the platform. There is a helpful
naigation bar on the lefthand side and pages with headings produce a table of 
contents for easier navigation on the right.

Need help with something and it's not here? Please [contact me] so I can update
the documentation. If you see an error, no matter how small, you can also 
create a pull request by clicking the *Edit this page* link. 

Thanks for using [Mudmap]!
