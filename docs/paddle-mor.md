title: Paddle for Payments
---

Mudmap uses [Paddle] as its payment gateway. Using Paddle gives Mudmap 
greater flexibility to provide you with better rates, effiecient tax 
handling and the option to choose Credit Card or Paypal to make purchases.

:::note paypal support is coming
Paypal is supported by Paddle and at writing yet to be implemented into 
Mudmap. It will be implemented but if it is a *show stopping* requirement for 
you then 
get 
in touch via the [contact page][contact] and let me know.
:::

Paddle also handles all the security for your payments - rest assured 
that your sensitive financial data is stored by Paddle not Mudmap. This also 
means disputes, charge backs and fraudulent payments are handled by a company 
geared for this, rather than relying on Mudmap. 

What's this mean for you? All the support, security, payments and
invoices are all handled by Paddle. For more information refer to their
[website][paddle].


:::tip tl;dr
Payments are linked to your user account. There is no way to change this
yet, however it is on the roadmap. Please get [in touch][contact] if you
need to update your accounts email for payments.

### I have a payment issue

If you have a dispute, issue or query, the 
first point of contact should be the [contact] page. Should it need more 
attention, then Paddle can get involved and handle it with their own 
customer service.
