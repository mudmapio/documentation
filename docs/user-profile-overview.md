title: User Profile Overview
---

Every account has an associated *User Profile*. In the top right hand side 
of the dashboard is a dropdown. Inside the dropdown is *Profile*.

The Profile page will show you some important account information:

- Account email
- Number of registered devices
- Expected monthly bill
- Subscription renewal date

If you are subscribed, it is here where you can update payment details or 
cancel your subscription. Cancelling your subscription will still give you 
access to the platform until the renewal date has passed. After which you 
will be able to login but no device information will be presented to the 
user interface.

Your data will be permanently deleted 60 days after your last subscription 
renewal date has passed.
